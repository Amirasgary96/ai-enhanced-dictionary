The person may experience changes in sensation, mood or emotion leading up to the tonic-clonic seizure. Eclampsia convulsions occur in two phases: 1. First phase, typically lasts 15-20 seconds, begins with facial twitching and proceeds to the muscles becoming rigid with generalized muscular contractions. 2. Second phase, typically lasts approximately 1-2 minutes but can last up to 4 minutes, consists of muscles of the body alternately contracting and relaxing in rapid succession. This phase begins with the muscles of the jaw, eyelids, and other facial muscles, then all the muscles of the body. Total loss of consciousness follows the convulsions, and some women may become cyanotic or experience tongue biting and incontinence. After the seizure, the patient may be confused, disoriented and sleepy and remember nothing of the recent events.",

   "Definition": "The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have identified three types of obstetric ultrasound examinations performed during pregnancy: standard (basic), limited, and specialized. 1. Standard (basic) obstetric ultrasound: - First trimester: includes an evaluation of the presence, size, location, and number of gestational sac(s). The gestational sac is examined for the presence of yolk sac and embryo/fetus. - Second or third trimester: includes an evaluation of fetal number, cardiac activity, presentation, amniotic fluid volume, placental position, fetal biometry, and an anatomic survey. The maternal cervix and adnexa should be examined. 2. Limited Ultrasound Examination - A limited obstetric ultrasound examination is performed to answer a specific, acute clinical question. For example, a limited examination may be performed to confirm fetal heart activity, placental location, or fetal presentation; estimate amniotic fluid volume; evaluate the cervix; assess embryonic or fetal viability. 3. Specialized Ultrasound Examination - A detailed ultrasound examination is performed on women at risk for fetal anatomic or genetic abnormalities or when an anomaly is suspected on the basis of history, abnormal biochemical markers, or the results of either a limited or standard scan. See Appendix B. - Other specialized ultrasound exams may include a fetal echocardiogram, biophysical profile, and fetal Doppler ultrasound, or additional biometric measurements including nuchal translucency (NT) and cervical length.",
